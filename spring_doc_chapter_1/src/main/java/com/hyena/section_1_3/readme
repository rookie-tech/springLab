Bean Overview


A spring IoC container manages one or more beans.(spring容器管理很多bean).these bean definitions are represented
as BeanDefiniton objects in container , which （指代BeanDefinition）contain the following metadata:

.A package-qualified class name（类的全限定名称) : typically , the actual implementation class of the the bean being defined
    //  Instantiate


.Bean behavior configuration elements , which state how the bean should behave in the container
(scope , lifecycle callbacks , and so forth)  // Configure


.References to other beans that are needed for the bean to work . these references
are also called collaborators or dependencies  // Assemble

.other configuration settings to set in the newly created object -for example,
the size limit of the pool or the number of connections to use in a bean that manages
a connection pool   // 这个是bean的其它配置，不是spring bean配置中的关键步骤。
